                <td style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;background-color: azure;font-weight: 500;">A Facebook Profile is what you probably think of when someone mentions Facebook. It’s a personal account for one person that’s (meant to be) in their real name.

                    With a Facebook Profile, you can:
                    
                    Connect with people by adding them as Friends or Following them (although you are limited to a maximum of 5000).
                    Share statuses, photos, videos, links, and so on with your Friends and Followers. <br>
                    Post comments and share things on your Friends’ accounts or message them privately through Facebook Messenger. <br>
                    Like Pages and join Groups. <br>
                    Set up your own Pages and Groups. <br>
                    There are obviously a lot more features, but that’s a broad overview of the main ones. <br>
                    Although you will see some people set up Profiles for their businesses or some other purpose, it’s frowned upon by Facebook. A Profile is for a real person, not a shop.
                </td>
                <td style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;background-color: azure;font-weight: 500;">A Facebook Group is closer to a community forum than either a Profile or Page. Depending on how the Group is set up, it can be open to anyone on Facebook or just a chosen few. Most Groups are for people who share a common interest or are members of a club. <br>
                    With a Facebook Group, members can: <br>

                    Post things to the Group. <br>
                    Comment on Group posts and interact with other members. <br>
                    Sell things. <br>
                    You need a personal Facebook Profile to set up a Facebook Group, and the fact you are an admin will be public information.
                </td>
                <td style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;background-color: azure;font-weight: 500;">A Page is similar to a Profile except it can be for anything—not just people. There are Pages dedicated to everything from famous authors to local secondhand car dealerships and circus troupes to fan fiction. <br>
                    If you’re looking to set up some sort of Facebook presence for your business, artwork, superhero alter ego, or even a more professional presence for yourself, a Page is what you’re looking for. <br>

                    With a Facebook Page, you can: <br>
                    
                    Have people connect with you by Liking the Page. <br>
                    Share posts that your Followers will see. <br>
                    Comment on posts on your own page. <br> 
                    Respond to messages sent to your <br>
                    Run advertising campaigns. <br>
                    Again, there are other features but those are the most important ones. <br>
                    
                    You need your own personal Facebook Profile to set up a Facebook Page, although you don’t need the information to be public.
